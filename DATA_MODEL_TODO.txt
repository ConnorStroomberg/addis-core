Importer TODO:

 - activity administered_drugs -> has_drug_treatment ; no longer use list
 - outcome is_measured_at moment
 - measurement of_arm -> of_group
 - measurement of_outcome -> of_variable
 - study has_included_population X
 - convert publications to bibo:Document with bibo:pmid
 - NCT IDs?
 - refer to measurement moments in outcomes
 - labels for measurement moments
 - import of overall measurements -> included_population
 - move measurementType to instance; rate -> binary.
 - change has_blinding_type
 - change has_allocation_type
 - has_indication -> has_health_condition_studied
 - status -> has_overall_status
 - measurementType / has_outcome -> new outcome structure
 - define drugs / indications (conditions) at study as well as at dataset

Ontology TODO:

 - solution to has_epochs
 - import qudt for units

 - Measurements
    - category_count, categoryList
    - count, mean, sample_size, standard_deviation
 - Study (compare these to OCRe)
    - has_number_of_centers
 - Datasets / concepts
    - Define Variable or whatever
 - Participant flow

 - Trial registry URLs + (ID -> URL) + ID pattern?
