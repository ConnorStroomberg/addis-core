        <p>You can create a new copy of this project that is based on the latest version
          of the source dataset. The new project will contain all the outcomes, interventions,
          and covariates that you have defined (provided that the concepts they are
          based on still exist in the updated dataset). It will keep all network
          meta analyses, for which the outcome, interventions, and covariates still
          exist. It will keep all models for which the same entries still exist.</p>
        <p>Once the update is complete you will be taken to the new project, and this
          project will be archived.</p>
        <p>Are you sure?</p>
